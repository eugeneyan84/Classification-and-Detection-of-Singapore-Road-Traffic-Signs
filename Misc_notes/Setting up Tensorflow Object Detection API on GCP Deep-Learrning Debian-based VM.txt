This tutorial assumes that a debian-based VM has been created and user is currently logged in via SSH.

1) Within Home directory, issue pip command to install Cython. This is to help with pycocotools installation at step-13 onwards.
pip install cython

2) Create new directory for Tensorflow
mkdir Tensorflow

3) Enter Tensorflow folder
cd Tensorflow

4) Git clone the whole tensorflow object detection API
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models

5) Navigate back to Home, then download protocol buffers binary for Linux
curl -OL https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v3.14.0/protoc-3.14.0-linux-x86_32.zip

6) Create new directory for protocol buffers
mkdir protobuf

7) Move download zip file to the new folder created in step-6
mv protoc-3.14.0-linux-x86_32.zip protobuf/

8) Enter protobuf folder
cd protobuf

9) Unzip the protobuf zipfile
unzip protoc-3.14.0-linux-x86_32.zip

10) Copy the protoc binary into the Tensorflow/models/research/ folder
cp bin/protoc ~/Tensorflow/models/research/

11) Navigate to the Tensorflow/models/research/ folder
cd ~/Tensorflow/models/research/

12) Convert protos into python scripts with following command
protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out=.

13) Navigate back to Home, git clone pycocotools
git clone https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git

14) Navigate to PythonAPI folder in the cocoapi folder
cd cocoapi/PythonAPI/

15) Build the pycocotools
make

16) After build is successful, copy the pycocotools folder to the ~/Tensorflow/models/research/ folder
cp -r pycocotools ~/Tensorflow/models/research/

17) Navigate to the Tensorflow/models/research/ folder
cd ~/Tensorflow/models/research/

18) Copy tf2 setup script to the research folder
cp object_detection/packages/tf2/setup.py .

19) Use the following command to perform actual installation of object detection API
python -m pip install .

20) Run sanity check script to verify installation of object detection API
python object_detection/builders/model_builder_tf2_test.py

21) Follow instructions at [Setting up Chrome Remote Desktop for Linux on Compute Engine] to set up remote-desktop access from local computer to VM instance
